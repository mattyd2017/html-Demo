			Html is the engine that drives the internet it was developed in 1989 at CERN in order for scientists to communicate 
			documents to each other and share their findings as an understandable format it was berners lee who orginally developed the first 
			practical way of accessing files and retriving the text</br>
			to co-incide with his development tim berners lee developed the first web browser that could interupt the hypertext into a readable format
			this browser was called enquire and he designed it to run on the NeXT personal computer.</br>
			The fact that the Web was invented in the early 1990s was no coincidence. Developments in communications technology during that time meant that,
			sooner or later, something like the Web was bound to happen. For a start, hypertext was coming into vogue and being used on computers. Also, 
			Internet users were gaining in the number of users on the system: there was an increasing audience for distributed information. Last, 
			but not least, the new domain name system had made it much easier to address a machine on the Internet.

			though already established as a concept by academics as early as the 1940s, it was with the advent of the personal computer that hypertext came out of the cupboard. 
			In the late 1980s, Bill Atkinson, an exceptionally gifted programmer working for Apple Computer Inc., came up with an application called Hypercard for the Macintosh. 
			Hypercard enabled you to construct a series of on-screen `filing cards' that contained textual and graphical information. Users could navigate these by pressing on-screen buttons,
			taking themselves on a tour of the information in the process.
			Hypercard set the scene for more applications based on the filing card idea. Toolbook for the PC was used in the early 1990s for constructing hypertext training 
			courses that had `pages' with buttons which could go forward or backward or jump to a new topic. Behind the scenes, buttons would initiate little programs called scripts.
			These scripts would control which page would be presented next; they could even run a small piece of animation on the screen. The application entitled Guide was a similar application for UNIX and the PC.
			Hypercard and its imitators caught the popular imagination. However, these packages still had one major limitation: hypertext jumps could only be made to files on the same computer. 
			Jumps made to computers on the other side of the world were still out of the question. Nobody yet had implemented a system involving hypertext links on a global scale</br>
			Far from keeping his ideas private, Tim made every attempt to discuss them openly online across the Internet. Coming from a research background, this was quite a natural thing to do. 
			In September 1991, the WWW-talk mailing list was started, a kind of electronic discussion group in which enthusiasts could exchange ideas and gossip. By 1992, a handful of other academics and computer researchers were showing interest. 
			Dave Raggett from Hewlett-Packard's Labs in Bristol, England, was one of these early enthusiasts, and, following electronic discussion, Dave visited Tim in 1992.
			Here, in Tim's tiny room in the bowels of the sprawling buildings of CERN, the two engineers further considered how HTML might be taken from its current beginnings and shaped into something more appropriate for mass consumption. 
			Trying to anticipate the kind of features that users really would like, Dave looked through magazines, newspapers and other printed media to get an idea of what 
			sort of HTML features would be important when that same information was published online. Upon return to England, Dave sat down at his keyboard and resolutely composed HTML+, a richer version of the original HTML.
