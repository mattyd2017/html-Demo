	<h1>A quick guide to html tags</h1>
	
	
	<p class = "paraformat">
	Tags are the most important aspect of html and the most fundamental part of been able to develop a HTMP document that is then displayed on the 
	webpage for example this a paragraph which use the paragraph tag which is &lt/p&gt this allows the web broswer your now using to interrpret whats 
	in between the tags to be viewed there are many other tags listed below are the more basic tags and what impact they have on how the page is viewed
	and formated</p>
		
		<ul class = "lists">
			<li class = "listvalue">this list was created using the list tag which has two main tags these are the &lt/ul&gt tag which means unordered list ie is just bullet pointed as opposed to have a count as in 
			an ordered list this tag uses the &lt/ol&gt and then you have the list elements which use the tag &lt/li&gt I have chosen the unordered list because i found it was a better design then an ordered list <br />&nbsp; </li>
			<li class = "listvalue">this is the &lt/h1&gt header whis is used is usually used as the main title to your page this is usually used at the top of the page and provides good impact for your page
			other tags that are used are &lt/h2&gt and &lt/h3&gt these tags are varying in size &lt/h1&gt been the bigges and &lt/h3&gt been the 
			smallest this is an example of a header tage in the code used to build this site<br />&nbsp;<img src= "images/H1 tag.png" alt = "h1 tag" title = "example of html hedeadline tag" width = "900px"style="margin:2px 2px"> <br />&nbsp;</li>
			<li class = "listvalue">the other tag that plays a cruical part in html is the tables tag although recently people and technologies are moving more towards the grid and resposive web applications with bootstrap grid and css grid 
			but tables are still as important as they always were the table is made up od 3 tags. these are the &lt/table&gt tag which is used to declare the table block and then inside the tble tags are 3 other tags that are used to
			head the table and to build the table columns. the fist tag is the &lt/th&gt which is used to give the table a title header then to construct the table the following tags are used &lt/tr&gt is used to decaler table rows and 					
			finally there is &lt/td&gt to declare the table colums the size of the table is set by how rows and colums you add the page formatting for this is handled by the css and styling here is an exampe 
			of the code used in the table page <br />&nbsp;<img src = "images/table.png"alt = "table tags" title = "example of html table tags" width = "900px"style="margin:2px 2px"> <br />&nbsp;</li>
