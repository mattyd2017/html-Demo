			The reason that i have chosen to build a site on the subject of html is to demonstrate knowledge of html and the best way i realised to do this was to make the theme of the 
			website about Html whilst its not a very entertaining subject to some people. I have come up with the concept
			of making each page work from the concepts discusssed on the page that the user is viewing and give breif 
			examples of code and that the page has been constructed using the subject discusssed on the page.
			for example the tables page was built by using tables and for lack of a better idea
			this site is to show perspective employers that i have a good knowledge of html and can design a website from the ground up
			although the subject matter might be the most engaging however i thought that building a website that uses all the 
			funtionality of a website that could be professionally done although i am relatively in experienced and just beginning
			my career hopefully in the amazing world of programming and web development and building a better future for myself</br></br>
			it was thought that a website that shows functionality and formatting but explain what the function is and that i am
			able to demonstrate i have relatively good grasp on html concepts and practices. And is able to show that they understand
			the fundamentals of html and also show that I understand html.  
			this website willfeature basic and more advanced features such as javascript and CSS and more advanced features of the 
			html framework this is an example of a paragrapgh in html if you look at the page source which can do done by
			right clicking on the wepage and selecting page source.
